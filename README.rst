The PennyLane-ProjectQ plugin integrates the ProjectQ quantum computing library with PennyLane's
quantum machine learning capabilities.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine
learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

`ProjectQ <https://projectq.readthedocs.io>`_ is an open-source compilation framework capable of
targeting various types of hardware and a high-performance quantum computer simulator with
emulation capabilities, and various compiler plug-ins.

This PennyLane plugin allows to use both the software and hardware backends of ProjectQ as devices for PennyLane.

The documentation can be found at `https://pennylane-pq.readthedocs.io`_.


Features
========

* Provides three devices to be used with PennyLane: ``projectq.simulator``, ``projectq.ibm``, and ``projectq.classical``. These provide access to the respective ProjectQ backends.

* Supports a wide range of PennyLane operations and observables across the devices.

* Combine ProjectQ high performance simulator and hardware backend support with PennyLane's automatic differentiation and optimization.

Installation
============

This plugin requires Python version 3.5 and above, as well as PennyLane and ProjectQ. Installation of this plugin, as well as all dependencies, can be done using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install pennylane_pq

To test that the PennyLane ProjectQ plugin is working correctly you can run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make test

in the source folder. Tests restricted to a specific device can be run by executing
:code:`make test-simulator`, :code:`make test-ibm`, or :code:`make test-classical`.

.. note::

    Tests on the `ibm device <https://pennylane-pq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devices.html#projectqibmbackend>`_
    can only be run if a :code:`user` and :code:`password` for the
    `IBM Q experience <https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/experience>`_ are configured
    in the `PennyLane configuration file <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/api/pennylane.Configuration.html>`_.
    If this is the case, running :code:`make test` also executes tests on the :code:`ibm` device.
    By default tests on the :code:`ibm` device run with :code:`hardware=False`. At the time of writing this
    means that the test are "free". Please verify that this is also the case for your account.
