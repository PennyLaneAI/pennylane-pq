Once Pennylane-ProjectQ is installed, the provided ProjectQ devices can be accessed straight
away in PennyLane, without the need to import any additional packages.

Devices
~~~~~~~

PennyLane-ProjectQ provides three ProjectQ devices for PennyLane:

Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~

To see the PennyLane-ProjectQ plugin in action, you can use any of the qubit based `demos
from the PennyLane documentation <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations.html>`_, for example
the tutorial on `qubit rotation <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation.html>`_,
and simply replace ``'default.qubit'`` with any of the available ProjectQ devices, such as ``'projectq.simulator'``:

.. code-block:: python

    dev = qml.device('projectq.simulator', wires=XXX)

You can also try to run tutorials, such as the qubit rotation tutorial, on actual quantum hardware by
using the ``'projectq.ibm'`` device.
